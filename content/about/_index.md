One day, I decided I didn't want to eat meat anymore.

Now, I live on a smallholding. I've bred pigs and sheep. I've hatched countless fowl. I've splinted the legs of hatchings when their were spraddled and bottle fed lambs who took residence in the kitchen in front of the Rayburn. I looked after them with tenderness, raised them, and took them to slaughter at small and friendly abbatoir. I've killed, plucked and dressed my Christmas dinner. In short, I'm not squeamish about meat but I always felt that there was right and kind way to farm it.

I changed my mind.

I have a terrible memory so this place serves as a place for me to capture recipes I like. I can also checkout the lists of ingredients I need while wandering doing my shopping. It works better for me than writing them down in a notepad.

# On the naming of things

The name of the blog has no particular meaning. Well, actually it started out years ago as an oblique reference to the cyanide laced [apple](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#Death) Alan Turing was purported to have eaten. I just had the domain lying around and re-used it.

Billy Ruffian is a pseudonym. After all, on the internet, no one knows if you are an 18th century [warship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Bellerophon_(1786)) or not.
