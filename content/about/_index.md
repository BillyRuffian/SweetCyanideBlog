One day, I decided I didn't want to eat meat anymore.

I've raised animals for food and long believed it was possible to farm in ways which are kind and right.

I changed my mind. I don't keep farm animals anymore and don't eat meat.

## The purpose of this

I'm learning how to cook again. I have to build up a bank of things I like to eat to replace a few decades of meals I could cook without thinking.

Because I have a terrible memory, this place serves as a place for me to capture recipes I like. I can also checkout the lists of ingredients I need while wandering doing my shopping. It works better for me than writing them down in a notepad.

## Food rules, the rules of food

Eating should be enjoyable. Cooking should be fun. Other people should enjoy sharing food with you even if they are meat eaters.

I'm a brit and following that particular cooking tradition, a plate ought to have a 'main event' with a supporting cast of other vegetables unless the meal is in a different culinary style.

Faking it with meat-subsitutes is sometimes ok but it's not ideal. 

## On the naming of things

The name of the blog has no particular meaning. Well, actually it started out years ago as an oblique reference to the cyanide laced [apple](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#Death) Alan Turing was purported to have eaten. I just had the domain lying around and re-used it.

Billy Ruffian is a pseudonym. After all, on the internet, no one knows if you are an 18th century [warship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Bellerophon_(1786)) or not.

## On the working of things

The blog is statically generated by [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) which really is fast. The theme is [Cactus Plus](https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-cactus-plus) -- I like it. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) is the engine which turns my markdown into HTML and I can't praise it highly enough.
