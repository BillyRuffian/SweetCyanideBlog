A whole lemon, toffee sauce and suet pastry.

## About
This pudding demands suet and vegetarian suets are made from palm oil which is problematic for many. Suma make a sustainably sourced [vegetarian suet](https://www.sumawholesale.com/suma-suet-vegetarian-6-x-250g-gt028.html) which goes a little way to assuaging my conscience. 

This one of those very old English [puddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex_pond_pudding) which provide a weekâ€™s worth of calories in one sitting. It's stodgy, unrefined and delicious. The lemon is the thing that makes or breaks this pudding. Ideally, you want a large, thin-skinned one but it must be unwaxed. 

For steaming, use a slow cooker. Nobody's got time to hover over a stove top for three hours. Add enough water to bring the level two-thirds of the way up the pudding bowl and turn on low for 5 or 6 hours: you want some steam generated but you don't want it bubbling away. 

You're going to need an old fashioned pudding basin. A 750ml one would be perfect, but I use a litre bowl and under fill it. 

## Ingredients
**For the pastry**
1. 150g self-raising flour
2. 75g vegetarian suet
3. 2 good pinches of salt
4. 100ml milk
5. Optional: handful of currents or sultanas 

**For the filling**
1. 100g of fridge temperature butter, cubed
2. 100g of soft brown sugar
3. A whole, unwaxed lemon


## Method
Mix the pastry ingredients together using a wooden spoon, switching to using your hands once it has come together. Turn out onto a floured surface and work with floured hands until it's not sticky. 

Grease the pudding bowl with butter generously. 

Reserve a quarter of the pastry for the lid and rollout a large circle drape it over the pudding bowl and shape it with your hands to form the sides. 

Prick the lemon well all over. 

Pop a few cubes of butter and some of the sugar in, then the lemon, then the rest of the butter and sugar. 

Rollout the reserved pastry to make a lid and join it to the rest by wetting the edges. 

Cut some parchment to cover the top of the bowl and secure with an elastic band or string. Steam in on the hob for 3 hours or better in the slow cooker for 5-6 hours. Turn it out half an hour before eating to let the buttery lemon juices absorb into the pastry.
