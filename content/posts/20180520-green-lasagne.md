This is a ‘trust me, it works’ recipe. Although it seems a bit bonkers from the ingredients list, it works well.

## About
There’s a quick bit of prep but then its just thrown in the oven until cooked. I made this the other day but didn’t have ricotta — soft cream cheese worked fine.

**Time** about 60 mins, **Difficulty** easy, **Serves** 4

## Ingredients
1. lasagne sheets
2. 800g bag of frozen peas
3. 200g spinach
4. 2 cloves of garlic
5. bunch of asparagus
6. tub of ricotta
7. bunch of fresh basil
8. parmesan-style vegetarian cheese

## Method
Flash boil the peas, then take them off the heat. Take half of them and mush them with a potato masher. Cook the asparagus for a few minutes making sure they still have some bite then cut into small lengths. 

Slice the garlic and fry in a bit of oil then add the spinach and cook until wilted. Then chop the basil and add it to the spinach along with all the peas, asparagus, and ricotta and give it good stir and season with salt.

Add a layer of the mixture to a baking dish, top with a good quality of grated hard cheese. Top with a lasagne sheets. Repeat. Finish with a thin layer of the mixture on top and a slosh of olive oil over it. Having a thin layer lets the top lasagne sheets go lovely and crispy.

Pop it it a medium oven for about 40 minutes until the top has browned and is bubbling.
