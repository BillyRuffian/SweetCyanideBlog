Ridiculously easy baked feta.

<!--more-->

## About
This baked feta is really quick and easy and can be combined with a salad, couscous or other veg.

**Time** about 20 mins, **Difficulty** Really Easy, **Serves** 2

## Ingredients
1. About 200-250g feta
2. 4 tomatoes
3. handful black olives
4. handful of basil leaves
5. olive oil
6. chunk of sourdough bread (optional)

## Method
In a small baking tray, break the feta into big chunks. Cut the tomatoes into small pieces and put in the tray with a handful of the olives (out of a jar works fine).

If youâ€™re adding the bread, tear it up into small chunks and also add to the tray. It helps soak up the moisture that the tomatoes will release.

Coat in a good slug of olive oil and put in a low-ish oven for about 20 minutes until the feta starts to colour. 

Bring it out of the oven, add a smattering of basil and serve.
