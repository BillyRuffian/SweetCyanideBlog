Tip on making quick griddled aubergine.

<!--more-->

## About
I was left staring at an aubergine the other night wondering what the hell to do with it. I might be telling you how to suck your eggs, but this worked for me.

You need a griddle pan and a hot, hot stove. I cook on a Rayburn, so struggle to get a wickedly hot hob.

## Ingredients
1. aubergine
2. tahini paste
3. salt

## Method
Slice the aubergine lengthways into 1cm strips. Generously salt each side and lay on kitchen roll for 15 mins. 

Get your (cast iron) griddle pan to smoking hot.

Wipe down the aubergine slices and smear tahini paste on each side. Chuck them on the griddle in batches. Cook each side until it smokes and the griddle lines are burnt into the flesh.
