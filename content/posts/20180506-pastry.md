I struggled for years making pastry and avoided any recipe that needed some unless I happened to have some ready-made in the fridge. Then my mother gave me a stern talking to.

In practise, one recipe will do everything for you. You can use it for the base of flans and for sweet or savoury pies. The trick I was missing was the amount of water to add. 

## Ingredients

1. 8 oz / 225 grams of flour
2. 4 oz / 110 grams of butter, diced
3. a tiny amount of water

## Method

Rub the butter into the pastry to make a fine crumbly mess. Go lightly though, you dont want the heat from your hands to melt the butter -- pastry chefs have cold hands. 

Using a normal knife, one you would eat your food with, stir the mixture as you add water a teaspoon splash at a time. As soon as the mixture starts to bind, stop adding water and get in there with your hands and form it into a ball. It might take a bit of persuading, but will come together. This is the magic trick. 

Chill it in the fridge for a little bit. 

When it comes to rolling it out, scatter flour on the surface and keep yourself in one place while you turn the pastry. This stops the dough from sticking. 

If you are making a sweet pie, scatter sugar on the pastry as you bring it out of the oven after baking.
