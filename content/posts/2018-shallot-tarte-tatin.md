## About
I use a flan dish to make tarte tatin and mine is huge, easily enough to feed 12 people. Nonetheless, the amount of shallots you’ll use is surprisingly large — don’t skimp.

**Time** about 1 hour,  **Serves** 12

## Ingredients
1. About 1kg of shallots
2. 6 tbsp balsamic vinegar
3. 1 tbsp of brown sugar
4. 1 sheet of ready-made puff pastry
5. 120g of mild, soft goat’s cheese, chopped into chunks
6. 2 big sprigs of thyme
7. 75g mixed grains
8. 25g butter and splash of oil

## Method
Put all the shallots, unpeeled into a big bowl and cover them with boiling water for about 10 mins. This makes the shallots easy to peel, but prepare for stingy eyes.

Put the oil and butter in a wide pan and put on a medium heat. Add the peeled shallots (you might need to batch this up). The aim to to cook them until they are slightly browned and sweet. It takes me about 1/2 hour.

Into the pan, slosh the balsamic vinegar and sugar and half the thyme leaves (stripped from the woody stems). Let it bubble away for a few minutes until it thickens a bit, tossing the onions through the liquor. 

Take off the heat an allow to cool. Stir though a pinch of salt.

Cut the pastry into a rough circle, just a little bit larger than the tarte tin. 

Put the rest of the thyme leaves into the tin, add the syrupy onions, Lay over the pastry and tuck it into the sides.

Pop it into a medium oven for about 1/2 until the pastry is golden and risen. Let it cool for 5 mins and then flip it over onto a plate and top with the goat’s cheese.
