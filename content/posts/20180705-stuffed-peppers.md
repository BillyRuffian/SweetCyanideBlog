## About
Stuffed peppers can be a bit of yawn, but I enjoyed this recipe and it’s versatile enough that you can swap in an out ingredients to suit what you fancy.

Time about 30 mins,  Serves 2

## Ingredients
1. 2 big red peppers
2. 75g mixed grains
3. Vegetable stock
4. 50g of soft goats cheese
5. Handful of frozen peas

## Method
Cook the grains in twice their own volume of stock (keep some extra on hand in case you need some more, sometimes they need a bit longer to cook). 

When the grains are cooked, take it off the heat, drain off any excess liquid and, while they’re still warm, mix through the cheese and the peas.

We’re going to need the peppers to stand up so if you need to, trim a little bit off the bottom of the pepper to help it but don’t pierce the flesh. Carefully slice the tops off the peppers. Scoop out and discard the seeds and pith. Stuff with the grain mixture and pop the top back on. 

Slosh a bit of olive oil over the peppers and pop in the over for about 10 minutes.
