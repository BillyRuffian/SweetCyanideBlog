About

I love posset with its silken texture and it’s so easy to flavour. Here I’m adding in fresh bay leaves which adds lots of depth to the flavour. If I didn’t have fresh, I wouldn’t bother adding dried leaves —- it’s not the same.

Unrefined castor sugar is best. I’ve used light brown muscovado before which adds a toffee flavour.

Makes about enough for 4. It’s very rich, so small portions here.

Ingredients

1. 250ml of double cream
2. Splash of milk
2. 4 fresh bay leaves
3. Zest and juice of a good lemon
4. 70g of unrefined sugar

Method

On a gentle heat, dissolve the sugar in cream, add a splash of milk to thin a little. Tear up the bay leaves and stir in. Bring to a gentle simmer for two minutes. Take off the heat, add the zest and lemon juice and leave for 15 minutes.

Strain the mixture through a sieve into shallow ramekins. Leave to set in the fridge for about 3 hours.
