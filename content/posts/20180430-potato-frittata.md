# About

**Time** about 30 mins, **Difficulty** Easy, **Serves** 4

# Ingredients

1. About 200g of new potatoes
2. A big onion
2. A clove or two of garlic
3. 4-6 eggs, lightly beaten
4. 40g Hard cheese, like cheddar
5. Butter or oil for the pan
6. Vegetable stock
7. Herbs

# Method

Cut the potatoes into small chunks. They want to be quite small. Fill a pan with just enough water to cover them, throw in a stock cube and get them boiling. You want these to be cooked through. When they're done, drain them and set them aside.

You will need a pan that you can put under the grill. I cook on a Rayburn so I need a metal-handled pan. Melt some butter or oil in a deep frying pan; I like truffle oil with a chunk of butter in it.

Roughly chop the onion, slice the garlic and chuck them in the pan to soften. When they're nice and soft, throw in the potatoes and let them sizzle for a few seconds to dry off any residual water. 

Add the beaten eggs. 6 eggs is a lot, 4 eggs just about glues it all together so adjust to your taste and the size of your pan. Add lots of coarsely grated black pepper and any other herbs you fancy. I like sweet paprika or taragon. Grate over most of the cheese and simmer for about 10 minutes on a gentle hob.

Resist the temptation to move the mixture around or you'll end up with scrambled eggs and potatoes.

When it seems to be quite set on the bottom, grate over a bit more of the cheese and put it under the grill for a few more minutes to brown the top.

Whip it out, chop some nice green herbs over the top, chives for instance, and dig in. If you're wanting it for a picnic, let it go cold in the pan first and it will be easier to lift out.
