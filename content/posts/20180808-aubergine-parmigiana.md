A rather impressive and delicious way to eat aubergine that’s pretty easy to rustle together.

## About
Imagine the lovechild of a lasagne and a moussaka. I make this is a square Aga baking dish and these qualities make an ok portion for 4 people but really needs a few sides to make the meal. That said, it’s not exactly low-calorie so maybe that’s a good thing.  

Time about 40 mins,  Serves 4

## Ingredients
1. Two large aubergines
2. Good handful of basil leaves
3. Medium onion
4. 3–4 garlic cloves
5. Tin chopped tomatoes
6. 400ml of Passata
7. A squeeze of tomato paste
8. 100g cheddar cheese, grated
9. 100g parmesan cheese, grated
10. Mozzarella ball
11. Splash of white wine (optional)

## Method
Let’s make the sauce. Finely dice the onion and chop the garlic, fry on a low heat until clear, chuck in the tin of tomatoes, passata, a squeeze of tomato paste, a glug of wine (if using) and most of basil leaves. Season well and let it simmer to reduce down a bit. 

While that’s bubbling, slice the aubergine into half-centimetre thick rounds. Brush with oil and place under the grill on a medium heat. I overlap the rounds and it’s fine. Grill them for about 10 minutes until they’ve got some colour. 

Mix together the parmesan and cheddar. It’s a lot of cheese. Take the sauce of the heat, we’re going to use it now.

Smear a little bit of sauce on the bottom of the pan. Lay a non-overlapping layer of aubergine, on the bottom, smear a thin layer of sauce over it and a good handful of the mixed grated cheese. Keep layering aubergine-sauce-cheese until the last layer when, hopefully, you can finish with the last bit of sauce and mixed cheese. Now blob chunks of mozzarella on top.

Pop in a fairly hot oven for about 20 minutes until it’s bubbling. Just like lasagne, crusty bits are delicious.
