There’s a little bit of prep to do for this recipe but its worth it. Using ready made gnocchi means the actual cooking time is only a few minutes.

## About
We’re going to make a pesto to start. I promise you that you want to do this rather than open a jar of ready made here and we’re not going to using a food processor or blender so there’s not a ton of washing up.

This recipe is open to loads of substitutions: use blanched almonds instead of pine nuts, rocket or chard instead of spinach, asparagus instead of beans, etc. The only thing you must use is the garlic, oil and cheese.

**Time** about 25 mins, **Difficulty** easy, but a bit of a faff, **Serves** 2

## Ingredients
1. 300g of ready-made gnocchi
2. 20g of pine nuts
3. handful of fresh basil
4. 2 cloves of garlic
5. 200g of cherry tomatoes
6. 100g of fine green beans
7. 200g of spinach
8. 50g crème fresh (optional)
9. 50g pecorino cheese
10. olive oil
11. lemon juice

## Method
In a dry pan over a medium-hot heat, toast the pine nuts until they are golden. Put them in a pestle and mortar and pound for a few minutes until they are reduced to a paste. 

Tip the pine nut paste into a bowl and grate (yes, grate not crush) your garlic cloves into the paste. Chop up the basil relatively finely, and add to your bowl. Add about half the pecorino, finely grated. Add a very good pinch of salt and a slosh of olive oil. It’s probably unbearably garlicky right now but we’re about to change that with the tomatoes. 

Halve the cherry tomatoes and add them to the pesto mix. Give them a bit of a smoosh with a fork. The pesto will draw out the moisture from the tomatoes which in turn will calm down the pesto. You might need more salt at this point. 

Cook your beans lightly, they should still have some bite and set aside. Wilt down the spinach and squeeze out excess water. 

No get a large, wide-based pan boiling. Add a good pinch of salt and a slug of oil and add the gnocchi. Once they float, they’re done and it’ll only take 5 minutes. 

Drain the gnocchi but save a cup of the cooking water. 

Add everything back to the pan over a warm heat. The spinach and the tomatoes will probably release more liquid, use a splash of the reserved cooking water if they don’t. The sauce should start to coat and cling to the gnocchi. Add a spoonful of crème fresh to make the sauce creamy. Add a squeeze of lemon juice and plate up.

Finish by grating the rest of the pecorino over the dishes and good grind of course black pepper.
