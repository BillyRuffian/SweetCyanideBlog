Broccoli is full of iron and vitamins C and K and tastes a rusty nail. Try this to make it yum. Also works to liven up any other boring green veg.

## About
Miso paste is a new thing for me and I’m in a phase of throwing it into everything. 

## Ingredients
1. 1 tsp of white miso paste
2. Fresh ginger, grated 
3. 1 tbs light soy sauce
4. Head of broccoli, cut into florets

## Method
Mix the miso, a good grating of ginger, the soy sauce together to make a paste. Boil / steam up the broccoli. 

When it’s cooked, quickly drain it, return to the pan and throw in the paste. Gently shake to pan around to loosen up the paste and to coat the broccoli.

There, now it tastes nice.
