Breakfasts at weekends are problem: a fry-up is a marvelous thing. Like-for-like vegetarian substitutions always feel, to me anyway, as a bit of a failure but a breakfast for kings needs something more than a fried egg.

This weekend, I tried a pack of Linda McCarney's [Red Onion and Rosemary Sausages](http://lindamccartneyfoods.co.uk/our-food/frozen-range/vegetarian-red-onion-rosemary-sausages/) (Â£2.00 from Tesco for a pack of 6), grilling them for about 15mins from frozen.

They're not as dense as a meat sausage but they cook well enough. There are clear chunks of red onion throughout and the taste of rosemary is really quite pronounced to the point where I was reminded of sage and rosemary stuffing. If you don't like strong herby flavours, move along to the plain version. 

I liked them. I thought they'd make a good sausage and mash dinner too. Will buy these again.
